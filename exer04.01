# Exercise 4.1
# 
# Explore the sensitivity of programming languages to errors of syntax. Try remov-
# ing the semicolon from the end of any statement of one of our working programs
# and examining the error messages that result, if any. Try changing other syntacti-
# cal items: add a parenthesis or a curly brace; misspell "print" or some other
# reserved word; just type in, or delete, anything. Programmers get used to seeing
# such errors; even after getting to know the language well, it is still common to have
# some syntax errors as you gradually add code to a program. Notice how one error
# can lead to many lines of error reporting. Is Perl accurately reporting the line where
# the error is?
#

# Answer to Exercise 4.1

# There's no answer I can give; you just have to experiment for yourself!
