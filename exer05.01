# Exercise 5.1
# 
# Use a loop to write a nonhalting program. The conditional must always evaluate to 
# true, every time through the loop. Note that some systems will catch that you're in 
# an infinite loop and will stop the program automatically. You will stop your pro-
# gram differently, depending on which operating system you use. Ctrl-C works on 
# Unix and Linux, a Windows MS-DOS command window, or a Mac OS X shell 
# window.
#
# Answer to Exercise 5.1

# 1 is always true

while(1) {}

# You'll never get to the exit statement:

exit;
